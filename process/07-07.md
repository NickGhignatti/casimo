# 3rd Spring planning meeting 07-07
## What to do
- Implement the door, the entity from which the customers enter and exit the casino
- Implement the behaviour which moves the customer towards its favourite game
- Implement the history of the state of the simulation
- Documentation of some already implemented features will be added

## How to do it
- Discussion about the implementation of the state's history has been held, two options have been considered:
    - Observer pattern inside the model components
    - An external component, similar to a second view which receives the state and stores it.
