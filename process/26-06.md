# Sync-up meeting 26-06
Small pitch regarding the chosen frontend framework and architecture. Doubts have been raised regarding the choice of Scala.js and Laminar, since scala.js heavily uses signals for propagating updates, which might pollute the model's architecture.
It has been decided to deploy the application on GH pages, but the merge must not occur on fridays. So the first deployment
is delayed until next thursday.
