# 2nd Spring planning meeting 30-06
## Part one: what to do
- Complete the remaining tasks from the first sprint:
    - Boid-like behaviour for customers will be shown in the view
    - Showing games in the view
- Choose a proper representation of customers and their behaviour
- Implement new behaviours for both movement and in-game
- Implement a basic editor for the casino layout

## Part two: how to do it
The representation of customers and their behaviour has been discussed, two options have been considered:
1) A case class whose fields are the properties of the customer, such as position, speed and the behaviours using strategy pattern. This approach is simple and easy to implement, but it makes difficult future extensions.
2) Split data and logic into two separate entities
  - The behaviours will be modeled as functions which accepts the entire state of the simulation and returns a modified state. This approach exposes the model to every behaviour, violating the encapsulation principle. This problem can be mitigated by avoiding that behaviours depend on the concrete simulation state, but rather on locally defined traits defined by each behaviour (DIP: Dependency inversion principle).
  - The simulation state only exists as a case class which implements every trait of the behaviours.
This approach is more complex, it will surely need the use of generics and a task has been created to research the feasibility of this approach.
