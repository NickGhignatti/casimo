# 2nd Sprint retrospective meeting 04-07
## What went well
- Most of the tasks from the second sprint have been completed, including:
  - Boid-like behaviour for customers has been shown in the view
  - Games are shown in the view
  - A basic editor for the casino layout has been implemented

## What didn't go well
- Continuous integration has been broken for a few days and several hours have been spent in fixing it, which delayed the deployment of the application.
